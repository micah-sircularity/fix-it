# fix-it

**FIXIT!**

A simple web application project.

---

## Setup

To get started with fix-it, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the project files.

2. **Install Dependencies:**  Since this project includes `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, it likely uses npm (Node Package Manager) for dependency management. Run the following command in your terminal to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the necessary packages listed in it.

3. **Open in Browser:** Once the dependencies are installed (if any), you can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Simply double-click the `index.html` file or drag and drop it into your browser window.

## Usage

After completing the setup, you can use the fix-it application by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

The application logic and user interface are implemented using the files provided:

- `index.html`:  The main HTML file that structures the web page. Open this file in your browser to view the application.
- `style.css`:  Contains the styling rules to visually enhance the application.
- `script.js`:  Holds the JavaScript code that provides interactivity and functionality to the application.

Interact with the application elements within your browser window to explore its features.  Specific usage instructions may be provided within the application itself, depending on its functionality.
